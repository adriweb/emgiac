Steps to build

    First run configure and make natively/normally. You will need some of the generated executables. Optionally, also build test.c and see that it works (see instructions inside test.c).

    Run configure using something like
    export CFLAGS=-m32
    ./configure ABI=32
    make clean
    (export CFLAGS='-Os -s PRECISE_I32_MUL=1' does not work)
    EMCONFIGURE_JS=1 emconfigure ./configure --build=none --host=none

    Edit config.h and disable HAVE_QUAD_T, HAVE_OBSTACK_VPRINTF

    Run make using something like

    emmake make
